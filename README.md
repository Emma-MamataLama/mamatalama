### About Me:
A highly organized and friendly Software QA professional, able to establish long-term, positive and fun relationships with clients, co-workers and outside resources. I am passionate about ensuring the quality and reliability of software products. Motivated self-starter; with a strong foundation in testing methodologies and techniques, I am skilled at identifying and reporting defects, as well as developing and executing effective test cases. 

When I am not on the job, I like venturing various hands-on jobs projects like sewing, exploring cocktails recipes with different flavors and playing guitar.
